# Other documentation updates

Anyone can contribute a merge request or create an issue for GitLab's documentation.

This page covers the process for general contributions to GitLab's docs (other
than those which arise from release-related feature updates) can be found on the
documentation guidelines page under [other documentation contributions](index.md#other-documentation-contributions).

## Who updates the docs

Anyone can contribute! You can create a merge request with documentation
when you find errors or other room for improvement, or have an idea for all-new
documentation that would help a GitLab user or admin achieve or optimize their
DevOps workflows.

## How to update the docs

Follow GitLab's [Merge Request Guidelines](../contributing/merge_request_workflow.md#merge-request-guidelines).

## Merging

Anyone with master access to the affected GitLab project can merge documentation changes.
This person must make a good-faith effort to ensure that the content is clear
(sufficiently easy for the intended audience to navigate and understand) and
that it meets the [Documentation Guidelines](index.md) and [Style Guide](styleguide.md).

If the author or reviewer has any questions, or would like a techncial writer's review
before merging, mention the writer who is assigned to the relevant [DevOps stage](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages).

## Technical Writer Review

The technical writing team reviews changes after they are merged, unless one of
the technical writers already reviewed prior to the merge.

## Other ways to help

If you have ideas for further documentation resources that would be best
considered/handled by technical writers, devs, and other SMEs, please create an issue.
